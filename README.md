Mambo

Learning a new language is fun and exciting, but can also be a very daunting task when learning on your own. Mambo is a unique application that uses a spaced repetition algorithm to enhance user’s ability to quickly master Swahili vocabulary words by prioritizing words that the users specifically struggles with. As a result, the more often a user practices a word, the sooner they commit it to memory. 

What is Mambo

A mobile dictionary designed to help you effectively learn Swahili. Simply log in with the option of Google Authentication and Swahili words display awaiting your translation. When you answer correctly, the word is repositioned at the end of the vocabulary list. However, if you answer incorrectly, the word is repositioned forward 2 spaces in the vocabulary list to give you another shot at committing that word to memory. The app’s feedback tells you the correct answer if you’ve answered incorrectly or congratulates you when you’re on a roll. We store your progress so you can measure how well you’re learning the language as well as let users know where they can use more practice.
